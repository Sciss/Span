# Span Website

Run the site via a local web server as `sbt previewSite` which is a functionality of the [sbt-site](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-site) plugin. I publish the
 results to GitHub using `sbt ghpagesPushSite` which is provided by the [sbt-ghpages](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-ghpages) plugin.
